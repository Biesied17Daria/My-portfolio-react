            <p>Hello, my name is Daria. I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites.

                My journey into programming began at the end of 2022 when I had to leave my home due to hostilities in my country. Since my old life was left behind, I decided to change it 180 degrees and study website layout. I am currently learning technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React to create dynamic user interfaces and scalable web applications.

                I strive to constantly develop and improve my skills by learning new tools and frameworks. My goal is to create web applications that are not only functional, but also enjoyable to use.

                In my free time, I am also interested in sports - I go to the gym, and am passionate about Asian culture and food, which helps me find inspiration and creative solutions for my projects.

                Contact me via email [your email address] or through my social media profiles [insert profiles]. I am always open to new projects and collaboration opportunities.</p>
